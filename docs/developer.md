# Developer Getting Started Guide

This guide will explain the tooling that has been used so far by the sole developer. Things like Code editors are obviously down to the individual developer, but it's good to know
which workflows have actually been tested.

## Operating System

This has been developed on a Mac, and also within WSL. So any Linux environment should work well.
I can make no garauntees about running it natively in Windows, just use WSL if you have Windows.

## Tools

The following tooling will be required

- A code editor
  ** VS Code was used for everthing except for Java
  ** IntelliJ was used for the Java analysis backend

- Docker
  Used for building and running the application. Even in 'prod' I just use Docker compose.

- Node JS
  I specifically recommend using Node Version Manager, but this is not required

- Rust - The new backend (which will replace the Java \_ Spring Boot one) is written in Rust

- Golang
  My current suggestion for the submission API is to write this in Go.

- Just
  I have written automation for local dev tasks in the justfile, so this will be very helpful to have on hand. You could survive without it, but you would just end up manually invoking the same commands.

## Running the application

Ensure that your node is setup. If you installed nvm run

```bash
nvm use
```

Then use the justfile to start the entire system locally

```bash
just run
```

This will invoke the builds of the various docker containers, and then run them in Docker compose. It should then be possible to visit the UI locally on

(Local SDQ)[http://localhost:8080]

# Repository Layout

This monorepo contains everything required to get this system up and running.
It's under active development, and I've changed several key aspects already.
Currently the application is split into two functional verticals

- SDQ Analysis
- - The bulk ingest of spreadsheets
- - The running of queries across the whole dataset.
- SDQ Submission
- - An application for submitting individual data items, essentially replacing the spreadsheet based data capture.

Both aspects sit on top of the same database. The creation of that database is a distinct module.

### sdq-database-liquibase

A container that uses liquibase to build the database.
I have already decided liquibase is too greedy (1GB image!) so will migrate to Flyway.

### sdq-analysis-api-java

The original backend service which contains the code for querying a postgres database.
The application is written using Spring Boot, exposing a REST API with the various queries.
This backend application also serves up the static resources of the frontend. This makes it easier to deploy.

### sdq-analysis-api-rust

A completely rewrite of the analysis API. Originally I used Java & Spring Boot since that's what I work with on client projects, then I noticed just how greedy the containers were.
The rust implementation takes a fraction (something like 2%) of the container size, and running memory footprint. So once this implementation is complete, the java one will be deprecated.

### sdq-analysis-ui

This is the front end for the analysis part of the system.
It uses Vite to build a React application.

### sdq-submission-api-go

This is a backend which will provide functionality for submitting new SDQ data in the first place. The current analysis system assumes data is captured via Excel Spreadsheets, then bulk ingested. In the long run, it would be much nicer to capture the data directly via a web interface.

## local

This contains the docker compose files required to run the system up. At the moment, docker compose is the only mechanism I've ever used to run the whole stack.

Potentially we could start messing with Kubernetes, but that's overkill at this stage, and I haven't ever tried building up a database in K8s so would recommend using AWS RDS for that.
